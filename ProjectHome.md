Pivotstep is a high-level programming language for writing
down social dances like Argentine tango and contra dance.
It uses the Blender 3D engine to compile a dance description
into character animation.

Think of it as LaTeX for choreography.

As of April 2010, this is still in the preliminary stages
and isn't ready for general use.

A slideshow describing it is available at http://pivotstep.org .
